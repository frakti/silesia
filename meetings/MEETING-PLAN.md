# Meeting Plan

1. Two groups:
  - *Greenhorns* - first-timers, people that would like to learn Node.js
    / JavaScript from the beginning.
    - Dedicated workshops: `javascripting` or `learnyounode`.
  - *Power Users* - regular users, experienced with Node.js.
    - Dedicated workshops: *any other than `javascripting` or `learnyounode`*.
2. Next, we are preparing place for at least three clusters (`javascripting`, `learnyounode` and others).
3. Each subgroup from the *Greenhorns* should have at least 2 mentors. They are responsible for:
  - Presenting how to use specified *workshopper*.
  - Helping with Node.js or packages installation.
  - Showing an introduction to the topic (*at most 10 minutes*).
  - Helping with the assignments and proactively asking if anyone needs help.
  - Encouraging networking between participants and doing breaks (rule of thumb - *5 minutes break for each 40 minutes*).
4. We should split *Power Users* to the smaller groups, with dedicated mentor. Responsibilities as above (introduction can be a little longer - *at most 15 minutes*).
5. Introduction and presentations can be performed in parallel.
6. After that, participants are working with the *workshopper* assignments on their own, mentors are there to help them and guide to a proper solution.
7. After finishing whole workshop participant chooses which one would like to do next (or ask a mentor, which one is recommended). After switching place, mentors should take care individually of that person.
